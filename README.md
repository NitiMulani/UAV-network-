<h1>Project Title: UAV Networks surveillance utilizing an effective load-aware multipath routing protocol</h1>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>

The project uses innovative multi-channel load-sensing techniques to deploy unmanned aerial 
vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance purposes. The research aims to improve the quality of data 
transmission methods and improve the efficiency and reliability of surveillance systems by 
exploiting the mobility and adaptability of UAVs does the proposed protocol intelligently 
distribute network traffic across multiple channels, considering the load of each channel , While 
addressing challenges such as load balancing, this study investigates the effectiveness of the 
protocol by simulations or practical tests on The expected results have improved UAV-based 
surveillance systems, more flexible and efficient networks for applications such as security, 
emergency response and the environment alignment of monitoring -Offering infrastructures , 
which contribute to efficient and reliable monitoring solutions.

<h3>Procedure:</h3>

1. Polygon Creation and Plotting
   * Create a polygon using coordinates. 
   * Plot the polygon and generate an image.
  
2. Image Processing
   * Convert the image to grayscale. 
   * Apply thresholding and create a binary matrix. 
   * Create filter matrices based on drone and image area ratios.
  
3. Drone Deployment
    * Determine drone centroids within the polygon based on image processing. 
    * Calculate distances and establish neighbour matrices.

4. Path Planning
    * Compute pathloss and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). 
    * Construct a drone graph based on SNR values. 
    * Determine active drones for communication. 
    * Find paths for communication based on remaining capacity.

5. Visualization
    * Plot the polygon with centroids and paths. 
    * Show paths and drone deployment over the polygon.

<h3>Result:</h3>

The outcomes showed that ELAMR changed into capable of correctly balance the network load 
via distributing the records transmission responsibilities many of the drones based on their 
channel capacity and battery degree. This ended in a significant discount in quit-to-quit put off 
and an improvement in the packet transport ratio, thereby enhancing the general performance 
and satisfactory of the surveillance provider.
